Define required packages and versions
requirements = [
    "torch==1.12.1+cu113",
    "transformers==4.22.2",
    "diffusers==0.10.2",
    "replicate-api==1.0.5",
    "ffmpeg-python==0.2.0",
    "SpeechRecognition==3.8.1",
    "pydub==0.25.1",
    "numpy==1.23.1",
    "Pillow==9.3.0",
    "scipy==1.9.1"
]

Write requirements to file
with open("requirements.txt", "w") as file:
    for requirement in requirements:
        file.write("%s
" % requirement)

#Alternative method using pip freeze
#call(["pip", "freeze", ">requirements.txt"])

 
 #even simpler version:

"""import os
os.system("pip freeze > requirements.txt")"""
#This script will generate a `requirements.txt` file in the same directory, containing the required packages and versions for the DreamPuppets project.

#To use this script:

"""1. Save this code in a file (e.g., `generate_requirements.py`)
2. Run the script using Python (e.g., `python generate_requirements.py`)
3. A `requirements.txt` file will be generated in the same directory

Do you:
A) Run the script now
B) Modify the script for your needs
C) Ask about the requirements list"""
